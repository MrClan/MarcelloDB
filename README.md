[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/markmeeus/MarcelloDB.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/markmeeus/MarcelloDB)

MarcelloDB is a mobile NoSql database.
It is very light-weight with minimal memory footprint.

MarcelloDB saves plain C# objects, including child objects, lists and collections.
Not having to map your objects to the relational model can save you hundreds of lines of code.

MarcelloDB is a pure C# implementation, so there is no need to package other binaries.

MarcelloDB is portable code: Xamarin (iOS and Android), Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 and Windows 10



Current Status
=
Marcello is still in an experimental phase.

Be carefull. Backwards compatibility with existing data will not be guaranteed untill v1.

Getting Started
````
PM > Install-Package MarcelloDB
```
Sessions
=
Using MarcelloDB starts with the creation of a session.
The session makes sure you have access to the actual files where the data is stored.
A session handles a set of data files in a specific folder.

MarcelloDB is a portable class library, but there are some platform specific things that simply cannot be written in portable code. Currently, MarcelloDB relies on a platform specific implementation for interacting with the file system.

All of this is hidden from you as it is wrapped inside the Platform object.

The Platform implementation for mono/.net which can be used for Xamarin iOS and Android can be found in the Marcello.netfx assembly.

The implementation for Windows Phone 8.1 and Windows 8.1 (not tested in Windows 10 yet) can be found in the Marcello.uwp assembly.

So first: create the Platform object in your platform specific project.

```cs
//Create a platform on the specific platform
var platform =  new Platform();
```

Then create the actual session.
(You can do this in a portable class library)
```cs
//Create a Marcello session, this can be done in PCL code
var session = new MarcelloDB.Session(platform, "/path/to/data/folder/");
```

CollectionFiles and Collections
=
MarcelloDB organizes it's data in collection-files and collections. A single session can handle multiple collection-files and a collection-file can handle multiple collections.

(This way you can have all read-only data in a single file which you can download straight from your servers. Another file could be used to write data f.i.)

You user collection-files like this:
```cs
var productsFile = session["products"];
```

With this collection-file, you can start accessing collections.
Collections are a bit like tables, the main difference is that they contain entire objects, not just rows with colums.
A collection can only handle objects of a specific type (including subclasses);

To start working with a collection, simple access it like this:
```cs
//Deals with instances of Book or subclasses of Book
var bookCollection = productsFile.Collection<Book>("books");
var dvdCollection = productsFile.Collection<Dvd>("dvd");
```
If you use different collection-names you can even have multiple collections for the same type within one collection-file.
```cs
//Deals with instances of Book or subclasses of Book
var bookCollection = productsFile.Collection<Dvd>("dvds");
var bookCollection = productsFile.Collection<Dvd>("upcomming-dvds");
```

Persisting objects
=
This is where it gets really easy. Once you have this collection, just throw an instance at it:
```cs
var book = new Book(){ ID = "123",  Title = "The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo" };
bookCollection.Persist(book);
```

Enumerating a collection
=
A collection exposes an All property which implements IEnumerable.
You can use it iterate all objects in the collection, and of course use Linq on it.
(Note that when using Linq, it is still enumerating the collection)
```cs
foreach(var book in bookCollection.All){}
```

Finding objects
=
You can find a specific object by it's ID (more on ID's below)

Find uses a btree index to search for objects. Depending on the size of your collection, a Find will be way faster than iterating the collection to find it.
Sub-millisecond lookups should be expected, even for large collections.

Usage:

```cs
var book = bookCollection.Find(123)
```
(In later versions, you'll be able to search and enumerate for other properties using the same index mechanism)

Deleting objects
=
Delete your objects like this:
```cs
bookCollection.Destroy(book.ID);
```

How Objects are Identified
=
MarcelloDB needs a single property which uniquely identifies an object.
This value is needed to build the main index and make a distinction between an insert or an update.

You can use any of the following naming conventions, or add the MarcelloDB.Attributes.ID attribute.
```cs
class Article
{
  public string ID { get; set; }

  public string Id { get; set; }

  public string id { get; set; }

  public string ArticleID { get; set; }

  public string ArticleId { get; set; }

  public string Articleid { get; set; }

  [MarcelloDB.Attributes.ID]
  public string CustomIDProp { get; set; }
}
```
The ID, Id and id property can be defined anywhere in the class hierarchy, but the ClassID, ClassId and Classid attributes will only be used if they are defined on the class which is used as the collection class.

```cs
class Product
{
  public string ID { get; set; }
}
class Chair : Product{}

//This will work
session["data"].Collection<Product>("products").Persist(chair);

//This will also work because an ID (or Id or id) property is found in the class hiÃ«rachy.
session["data"].Collection<Chair>("chairs").Persist(chair);


class Article
{
  public string ArticleID { get; set; }
}
class Book : Article{}

//This will work
session["data"].Collection<Article>("articles").Persist(book);

//This will not work because Book doesn't define an ID and ArticleID on the parent isn't considered.
session["data"].Collection<Book>("books").Persist(book);
```

Transactions
=
To avoid data corruption, all changes are written to a write ahead journal and applied as a single atomic and durable action.
MarcelloDB does this for calls to Persist and Destroy, but you can extend the transaction to make it span multiple data mutations.

A transaction runs on a session and can include changes in multiple collections from multiple collection files.

(Warning: only collections obtained from that session will be included in the transaction. If you start to mix multiple sessions, you're on your own.)
```cs
session.Transaction(() => {
    session["articles.dat"].Collection<Article>("articles").Persist(article);
    session["project_management.dat"].Collection<Client>("clients").Persist(client);
    session["project_management.dat"].Collection<Project>("projects").Destroy(project);
});
```

Transactions roll back when an exception occurs within the block.
```cs
session.Transaction(() => {
    session["articles.dat"].Collection<Article>("articles").Persist(article);
    session["project_management.dat"].Collection<Client>("clients").Persist(client);
    session["project_management.dat"].Collection<Project>("projects").Destroy(project);
    throw new Exception("Nothing happened");
});
```

Encryption
=
Data is stored in an unencrypted format. An encryption engine is available as a pro extension. Please contact mark.meeus at gmail.com for more info.
