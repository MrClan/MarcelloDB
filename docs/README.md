##MarcelloDB - Docs
Welcome to MarcelloDB documentation pages.

MarcelloDB is a mobile NoSql database.
It is very light-weight with minimal memory footprint.

MarcelloDB saves plain C# objects, including child objects, lists and dictionaries.
Not having to map your objects to the relational model can save you hundreds of lines of code.

It's a pure C# implementation, no need to package other binaries.

It's a portable class library: Xamarin (iOS and Android), Windows(Phone) 8.1 and Windows 10.


###New to MarcelloDB?

Read the [Quickstart Guide](quickstart.md) to get up to speed quickly.

A lot of thought went into the API design, we hope you'll like it.

If you have any questions, thoughts or remarks. Please open an issue on [github.](https://github.com/markmeeus/marcellodb/issues)

###Current Version:
Current version is 0.4.3

The API and data format are getting more stable with every release. However MarcelloDB is not guaranteed to be compatible with data from previous versions untill version 1.0

In other words: **not ready for production apps yet.**
We hope to be production ready at the end of 2016.

##Need Support?
After 1.0 is released, you'll be able to get developer support as part of the Pro/Support Package. This package will also include [MarcelloDB.Encryption](encryption.html).

Please contact mark.meeus@gmail.com if interested.
