##MarcelloDB - Docs
Welcome to MarcelloDB documentation pages.

MarcelloDB is a mobile NoSql database.
It is very light-weight with minimal memory footprint.

MarcelloDB saves plain C# objects, including child objects, lists and collections.
Not having to map your objects to the relational model can save you hundreds of lines of code.

It's a pure C# implementation, no need to package other binaries.

It's 99% portable code: Xamarin (iOS and Android), Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 and Windows 10


###New to MarcelloDB?

Read the [Quickstart Guide](quickstart.md) to get up to speed quickly.

I put a lot of thought in designing the API to be developer-friendly, I hope you'll love it.

###Current status:
Current version is 0.4

The API and data format are getting more stable with every release. However MarcelloDB is not guaranteed to be compatible with data from previous versions untill version 1.0

In other words: **not ready for production apps yet.**
