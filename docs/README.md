#Welcome to MarcelloDB's Documentation pages.

MarcelloDB is an [open-source](https://github.com/markmeeus/marcellodb) NoSql database (for Xamarin .net and mono) built to be used in mobile apps.

MarcelloDB saves entire C# objects, including properties with child objects, lists and dictionaries.

It's a native C# implementation, focussed on being light-weight and developer-friendly.

MarcelloDB's core is a portable class library for Xamarin (iOS and Android), Windows(Phone) 8.1 and Windows 10.


###New to MarcelloDB?

Read the [Quickstart Guide](quickstart.md) to get up to speed quickly.

A lot of thought went into the API design, we hope you'll like it.

If you have any questions, thoughts or remarks. Please open an issue on [github.](https://github.com/markmeeus/marcellodb/issues)

###Current Version:
Current version is 0.5.0

The API and data format are getting more stable with every release. However MarcelloDB is not guaranteed to be compatible with data from previous versions untill version 1.0

In other words: **not recommended for production apps yet.**
We hope to be production ready at the end of 2016.

##Need Support?
After 1.0 is released, you'll be able to get developer support as part of the Pro/Support Package. This package will also include [MarcelloDB.Encryption](encryption.html).

Please contact mark.meeus@gmail.com if interested.
